I am currently a senior researcher at the Institute of Computer Science at the University of St. Gallen (ICS-HSG) in Switzerland. I am part of the [Interactions research group](https://ics.unisg.ch/chairs/simon-mayer-interaction-and-communication-based-systems/) lead by Prof. Dr. Simon Mayer.

My research focuses on developing neurosymbolic AI methods to create socially and environmentally sustainable systems that can positively impact society.

Currently, I am working on the design of digital companions: autonomous systems operating on the Web that proactively assist users of smart environments. These companions leverage neurosymbolic AI and connected devices to perceive the state of the environment. The perceived data is then interpreted to compute proactive assistance for a user. A digital companion delivers this assistance either by directly actuating connected devices in the environment or by interacting with a user through innovative human interfaces, such as Mixed Reality.

To incorporate a sustainability dimension into these systems legal scholars working on data privacy, and environmental scientists working on GHG emissions accounting.

Interested in a Bachelor’s or Master’s project that blends symbolic and subsymbolic AI, IoT, robotics, or Mixed Reality?
