title: "Smart Management of Smart Grids (Finished)"
excerpt: "As electric distribution systems integrate more renewable energy, enhanced automation is needed to ensure reliability and responsiveness. During my time at Siemens, using semantic technologies, we developed a system for managing secondary electrical substations, offering real-time monitoring, automated control, and dynamic software deployment. We developed innovative dashboards to empower grid operators with intuitive visualization and proactive tools to detect, diagnose, and resolve grid issues efficiently. This project was supported by the California Energy Commission. [The report can be found here](https://www.energy.ca.gov/sites/default/files/2021-06/CEC-500-2019-059.pdf)."
